# Describe AWS CloudFormation change set Action for GitHub Actions
Describe cfn stack diff using `describe-change-set` API.<br>
cf. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-change-set.html

This action exports json output as an Github Action output variable that actions running later in a job can use.<br>
Additionally, exports table formatted diff file. Below shows how to use it to post pull request comment.<br>

ex. describe change set diff like management console.

`Changed Properties` is not shown on management console, but exists in `describe-change-set` API response.

      FILE_PATH: ${{ steps.describe-change-set.outputs.diff_file_path }}
    run: |
      cat ${FILE_PATH} | xargs echo
      curl -X POST \
           -H "Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
           -d "{\"body\": \"$(cat ${FILE_PATH} | xargs echo)\"}" \
           ${URL}
```

for example, you set trigger on `pull_request`, this action posts a comment which describes change set like management console.<br>

See [action.yml](https://github.com/Blue-Pix/describe-cfn-change-set/blob/master/action.yml) for the full documentation for this action's inputs and outputs.

# Environment variables
- `stack_name`:  CloudFormation stack name to apply change. (**required**)
- `template_body`:  CloudFormation template file path. (**required**)

# Credentials and Region
Use the [`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) to configure the GitHub Actions environment with environment variables containing AWS credentials and your desired region.

# Permissions
This action requires the following minimum set of permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudformation:CreateChangeSet",
                "cloudformation:DescribeChangeSet",
                "cloudformation:DeleteChangeSet"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

The Action calls `create-change-set` api with random uuid as change set name first, then `describe-change-set`.<br>
After writing output to file, remove temporary change set by `delete-change-set`.<br>
**Note.** do not restrict change-set-name in `Resource` condition because change-set-name is random.<br>
