    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  
  - name: configure AWS credentials
    uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
    with:
      aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
      aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

See [action.yml](https://github.com/Blue-Pix/describe-cfn-change-set/blob/master/action.yml) for the full documentation for this action's inputs and outputs.

# Environment variables
- `stack_name`:  CloudFormation stack name to apply change. (required)
- `template_body`:  CloudFormation template file path. (required)

# Credentials and Region
Use the [`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) to configure the GitHub Actions environment with environment variables containing AWS credentials and your desired region.

# Permissions
This action requires the following minimum set of permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudformation:CreateChangeSet",
                "cloudformation:DescribeChangeSet",
                "cloudformation:DeleteChangeSet"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

The Action calls `create-change-set` api with random uuid as change set name first, then `describe-change-set`.<br>
After writing output to file, remove temporary change set by `delete-change-set`.<br>
Note. do not restrict change-set-name in `Resource` condition because change-set-name is random.<br>
